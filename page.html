    <h1>CHAPTER 1</h1>
    <h3>
        Several old glazed ceramic wine jars were placed on a dark countertop, emitting a pleasant aroma that wafted throughout the lobby. A silver Taiping coin was spinning on the counter.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        The Innkeeper in a worn robe with a discolored green silk scarf on his head stood behind the counter. He propped his chin on his right hand as he stared at the spinning Taiping coin in a daze.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        A waiter sat on a long bench against the wall and nodded off, his head bobbing up and down like a chicken slowly pecking at its food.
    </h3>
    <h3>
        Suddenly, a man hobbled into the lobby.<br><br>
        The Innkeeper hurriedly reached out to stop the spinning Taiping coin on the countertop. He slowly removed his palm, revealing the words “peace to the world” that were engraved on the coin.<br><br>
        When the Innkeeper raised his head again, he had already plastered on his signature smile.<br><br>
        The man who entered looked to be in his forties, with a weathered face and scars all over. His left sleeve was void, and he was limping on his right leg.<br><br>
        However, this type of appearance was commonplace here. It neither frightened nor surprised anyone.<br><br>
        That was because this was The Inn.<br><br>
        Unlike ordinary inns, this “inn” was a rowdy place.<br><br>
        People from all walks of life—immortals and bumpkins alike—gathered here. Some patrons were rich and noble, dressed in lavish clothes, while others were criminals who could not see the light of day. There were also many mysterious figures around.<br><br>
        Facing the man, the Innkeeper asked, “Sir, what kind of services would you like today? Everything is negotiable, as long as the price is right.”<br><br>
        The limping man took out a brand-new cash note from his robe and slapped it on the counter in front of the Innkeeper. He said in a hoarse voice, “This cash note can be redeemed at any bank. It’s worth 1,000 Taiping coins.”<br><br>
        The Innkeeper glanced at the cash note and did not rush to speak.<br><br>
        The limping man continued, “Such a large sum of money is enough for most people to leave this industry, turn over a new leaf, and retire as a rich man.”<br><br>
        The Innkeeper nodded in agreement. “Sir, if you’d like to buy someone’s life, many people here are willing to take the gamble.”<br><br>
        The man shook his head and stressed. “I don’t want a hitman. I just want to keep someone safe from the hands of the Green Phoenix Guard.”<br><br>
        The man’s voice was not loud, but it was clear. The moment he uttered the words “Green Phoenix Guard,” the originally loud lobby turned silent. All the other “guests” paused in their movements, which showed how much of a notorious reputation the Green Phoenix Guard had.<br><br>
        The Innkeeper fiddled with the Taiping coin in his hand and explained, “In the Great Xuan Dynasty, the most terrifying thing to happen to office-bearers is not being dismissed from office. If they are dismissed, they can simply return home and enjoy their time with their wives and children. The most terrifying thing is to be arrested and interrogated by the Green Phoenix Guard.<br><br>
        “Once the Green Phoenix Guard is involved, it’s just a matter of time until someone dies and households are ruined. When someone falls into the Green Phoenix Guard’s hands, they often only have the chance to pray for a quick death. Most people are scared of death, but compared to being tortured by the Green Phoenix Guard, death is the greatest relief.”<br><br>
        The limping man remained silent.<br><br>
        The Innkeeper glanced at the uniform boots on the limping man’s feet and the blood stains on his clothes before he continued, “The Green Phoenix Guard have existed for two dynasties over the past 400 years and have a notorious reputation. Even the royal family, ministers, wealthy merchants, and master swordsmen are afraid of them. I’m afraid no one will dare take up your offer to protect someone from the Green Phoenix Guard. Do you understand what I’m saying, sir?”<br><br>
        The limping man sighed heavily. “I know, but this is The Inn.”<br><br>
        The Innkeeper laughed self-deprecatingly. “Well, we’re no longer what we used to be. The Inn and the Green Phoenix Guard don’t mess with each other’s business. If we cross the line, the Green Phoenix Guard will make life difficult for us. Do you understand what I’m saying now?”<br><br>
        The limping man fell silent and turned to scan the lobby.<br><br>
        No one dared to look him in the eye.<br><br>
        At first, the limping man was disappointed, but this disappointment gradually turned into despair.<br><br>
        Suddenly, a voice came from the corner of the lobby. “I’ll take this deal.”<br><br>
        After a moment of silence in the lobby, a flurry of whispers ensued, sounding like the annoying chirping of insects on a summer night or like a rat scurrying around in the night. Even the waiter, who had been dozing off, jolted up from his dream. He looked around first, then hurriedly got up from the bench and left the room, as if he was afraid of being implicated.<br><br>
        A sliver of hope arose again on the limping man’s face as he turned his head to look in the direction of that voice.<br><br>
        That voice came from a young man who was wearing a cloak and a bamboo rain hat—common attire for seasoned traveling swordsmen.<br><br>
        The young man sat in the corner of the lobby, occupying a table by himself. His short sword was placed on the table.<br><br>
        He stood up, walked over to the counter, then glanced at the cash note and commented, “One thousand Taiping coins is not a small amount. One could easily exchange it for a small mountain worth of Ruyi coins.”<br><br>
        During the previous Wei Dynasty, private currency was common, and forged money was rampant, leading to chaotic transactions and cumbersome conversions. Some office-bearers even made profits from it.<br><br>
        The Great Xuan Dynasty was aware of this problem. Thus, they created a standard system of three types of coins—gold, silver, and copper. They got rid of the square holes from the previous dynasty’s coins and made them into solid whole coins, which they named yuan.<br><br>
        The back of the gold yuan was engraved with the characters Chengping Wuyou.<br><br>
        Thus, the gold coin was more commonly known as the Wuyou coin.<br><br>
        The back of the silver yuan was engraved with the characters Tianxia Taiping. Thus, the silver coin was known as the Taiping coin.<br><br>
        Similarly, the back of the copper yuan was engraved with the characters Pingan Ruyi. Thus, the copper coin was known as the Ruyi coin.<br><br>
        The Innkeeper glanced at the empty bench not far from the counter and stretched out his hand to hold down the cash note. He advised calmly...
